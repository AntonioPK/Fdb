Version 1.5.2
• Corrected bug in 'no composites received' code, total count was not being incremented.
• Corrected a display bug when Factordb failed to respond to a composite request.
•
• All constants dependant on the maximum page rate allowed by Factordb.com replaced with variables.
• The value of these variables are calculated from the new variable holding the maximum page rate.
• This is additional support for changes introduced in version 1.5.1
•
• Modified 10 minute wait loops so that the user has to wait at most 1 minute before Ctrl-Q exits the code.
• Added log file option (-l): - Can now log data to Fdb.csv, a comma separated list consisting
  of composite size, number of prime factors found, time to factor (in seconds).
• Added auto increment for random offset (-a xx): - This is in addition to the maximum set by the -r option,
  each time a worker collision occurs the additional random offset will be incremented by xx (once the number
  of collisions exceeds 5% of the number of composites factored), it also invokes an automatic decrement of
  the additional random offset each time a collision does not occur.
  Suggested starting values: -r 10 -a 3
• 'Get composite' display has been modified to show the current maximum random offset (offset/maximum offset).
• Display of the count for each error type is supressed until the count for that error is > 0.
•
